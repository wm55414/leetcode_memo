# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
`interval overlap` 

## Tips

#### interval overlap
Once we meet a interval overlap problem, we should consider to move sort it by one side.
So that we only have to care about one side of the target.

1. sort the points by right. 
2. take the first right limit as the arrow shot coord.
3. once the coord can't reach the target point's left, replace it as the new point's right side, and add one to answer.

## Solution
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        int count = 1;

        // Since the limit of point[i][j] is int.MinValue and int.MaxValue,
        // We shouldn't use a[1] - b[1] in return, but use CompareTo Method in int class.
        Array.Sort(points, (int[] a, int[] b) => (a[1].CompareTo(b[1])) );
        int arrow = points[0][1];

        foreach(int[] point in points )
        {
            if(arrow >= point[0])
            	continue;

            // Once the arrow is exceed the left side of balloon, we shot another arror in the rightest of new point.
            arrow = point[1];
            count ++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
