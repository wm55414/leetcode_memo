# 132 Pattern
`Stack`

## Tips

#### Stack
The target of the question is to find the 132 pattern( i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]),
We can take that as "looking for the biggest value, and find the second biggest value of it right side",
and then "Search if the left value of it, is bigger than the second biggest value".

So, we can start from the right side, store the value in stack,
If we found a value is bigger than the uppest value of stack,
we take the number as [j] and take the value in stack which is bigger than num[j].
Once we have [j] and [k], we check if the next value is smaller than nums[j].


## Solution
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool Find132pattern(int[] nums) {
        //these are candidate second and third value;
        Stack<int> st = new Stack<int>();
        int third = int.MinValue;
        for(int i=nums.Length-1; i>=0 ;i--)
        {
            // if nums smaller than third,
            // since we applyed minValue for [j] in the begining.
            // We can assume that we got new second and new third value;
            if(nums[i]<third)
                return true;
            // use stack to find the second biggest value for [k]
            // if new value bigger than peek() value,
            // just keep pop it out.
            while(st.Count > 0 && nums[i]>st.Peek())
            {
                third = st.Pop();
            }
            st.Push(nums[i]);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
