# 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes
`extremely hard`, `graph`,`bit operation`

## Tips

### queue
how do we find the shortest path ? We will started from all the node. 
In each run, every posible in queue will move one step, and add it back to queue.
if node1 got two neighbor node2 and node3, we should add both of two possible route to queue.

### bit operation
In this solution must use bit as record. 
Since if we have to record the route we visited and compare it, it will be very complex to do while we save them as Array or List.

### record the situation
The most difficult part of the problem is "if we have already vist all the nearby nodes, how to choose the node to visit?"
We decide if we should visit the node base on the situation.
Since the last path count will start earlier, if the situation is duplicated, we just don't need to visit it.
i.e. node3->node4 now the statement is 1100, and we go to visit node 1, we shoud keep a record and visit node 1.
if   node4->node3 now the statement is still 1100, we don't need to visit node 1 again.

## Solution
```csharp
public class Solution{
    public int ShortestPathLength(int[][] graph)
    {
	// target present all nodes had been visited, 1<<3 -1 = 111
	// i.e. their got three node, if we visit node 1 we got 001, and then visit node 2 got 011
        int target = (1 << graph.Length) - 1;

	// tryQueue keep the node we Already visit, node now and steps count.
        Queue<int[]> tryQueue = new Queue<int[]>();

	// record remember the route we have already tried before, 
        int[,] record = new int[graph.Length, (int)Math.Pow(2,graph.Length)];
        for(int i = 0; i<graph.Length;i++)
        {
            tryQueue.Enqueue(new int[3]{1<<i,i,0});
            record[i, 1<<i] = 1;
        }
        while(true)
        {
            int[] tryNow = tryQueue.Dequeue();

	    // all nodes have already been visited.
            if(tryNow[0] == target)
                return tryNow[2];

	    // try all the nearby nodes.
            foreach(int nextNode in graph[tryNow[1]])
            {
		// if we are at node 1 (001) and if we go to node 2 (011), new mask will be (011)
                int newMask = tryNow[0] | 1 << nextNode;

		// !!!!! Important !!!!!
		// if we have visited nextNode when we are at the statement newMask, we don't need to visit it again,
		// since the first time we visit it, must got a lower path count.
                if(record[nextNode,newMask]==0)
                {
                    record[nextNode,newMask] = 1;
                    tryQueue.Enqueue(new int[3]{newMask,nextNode,tryNow[2]+1});
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
