# 287. Find the Duplicate Number
`Floyd algorithm` `Tortoise Hare` `Linked list`

## Tips
We should think the given array as a linked list,
when there is a duplicated value, there is a loop.
```
                - 
            /       \
st  -  - loop        |
            \       /
               tar
```
in this situation, we define the distance "st-loop"=x, "loop-tar"=y, "tar-loop"=z
=> x+y = x+y+z+y == x+2y+z

if we have a tortoise move 1 each move
then the hare who move twice as a tortoise must move 2 each move
if we have a tortoise move x+y each move
then the hare who move twice as a tortoise must move 2*(x+y) each move


since they must meet in the loop once,
we can assume the equotion x+2y+z = 2x + 2y => x = z

## steps

1. we find out the point they meet,
2. we move from start node and meet node in the same time
3. the place tey meet will be the duplicated point

## Solution
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int FindDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int slow = nums[0];
        int fast = nums[nums[0]];
        while(slow != fast)
        {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }
        fast = 0;
        while(slow != fast)
        {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }
        return fast;
    }
}
```
