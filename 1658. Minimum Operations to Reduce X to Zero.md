## Tips

#### remove both side equal remove middle
First we saw this problem may think about to use dynamic programming, 
recursively add both side of the array to find the ans.
But using above approaching will lead to exceed time limit.

We should change to think about try to remove the most element from middle.
First of all, we should count sum of array and minus by the target x,
to find out how much of sum we shoud remove in the middle.
Then we start from the left side, keep adding the elements.
Once the sum of elements exceed total-x, 
we should add some elements back (from the left side).
And if the sum of elements equal to total-x,
we check if the count of elements bigger than the record.

## Solution
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int MinOperations(int[] nums, int x) {
        int total = -x;

	//Count sum of the numms array.
        foreach(int num in nums)
            total += num;

	//It means x bigger than the total some of array, there won't got any ans.
        if(total<0)
            return -1;

	//We have to add all the element to find the ans.
        if(total == 0)
            return nums.Length;

	//record of the max remove elements
        int maxRemove = -1;

	//once the total smaller than 0, we add back elements from left side.
        int addBack = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i<nums.Length;i++)
        {
	    //Keep adding the element.
            total -= nums[i];

	    //While total smaller than 0, add the element back.
            while(addBack<=i && total < 0)
            {
                total += nums[addBack];
                addBack++;
            }

	    //If total equal 0, it should be one of the ans.
            if(total == 0 )
                maxRemove = Math.Max(maxRemove, i-addBack+1);
        }

	// if the max of remove elements still be -1, that means we didn't find any ans in cal.
        return  maxRemove == -1 ? -1 : nums.Length-maxRemove;
    }
}
```
